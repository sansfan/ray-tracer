how to add rotation:

3 variables, square root of squares of variables = 1

add these variables to x, y, z(of the starting point) every time you want to go up 1 pixel.


with rotation, make sure to move the camera position also. The line through the camera and center of the viewport should be perpendicular to the viewport.
